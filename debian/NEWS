apache2 (2.2.3-5) unstable; urgency=low

  Note to users of mod_proxy who have upgraded from Apache 2.0.x,
  and to users of mod_disk_cache:

  Due to a mistake, when mod_proxy was enabled during the upgrade from 2.0.x
  to 2.2.3, mod_disk_cache was enabled and disk caching was switched on. This
  could lead to the never shrinking disk cache filling up the /var partition.

  From 2.2.3-5, disk caching is switched off again in the default
  configuration of mod_disk_cache, as it was in 2.0.x. If you had mod_proxy
  enabled during the upgrade, you should check whether
  /var/cache/apache2/mod_disk_cache contains files that you don't want to be
  there.

  Users of mod_disk_cache should read the comments in
  /etc/apache2/mods-available/disk_cache.conf and check that their
  configuration is correct.
