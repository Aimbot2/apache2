Package: apache2-common
Architecture: any
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, apache2-utils
Description: Next generation, scalable, extendable web server
 Apache v2 is the next generation of the omnipresent Apache web server. This
 version - a total rewrite - introduces many new improvements, such as
 threading, a new API, IPv6 support, request/response filtering, and more.
 .
 It is also considerably faster, and can be easily extended to provide services
 other than http.
 .
 This package contains all the standard apache2 modules, including SSL support.
 However, it does *not* include the server itself; for this you need to
 install one of the apache2-mpm-* packages; such as worker or prefork.


Package: apache2-mpm-worker
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, apache2-common (= ${Source-Version})
Provides: apache2-modules, apache2, httpd, httpd-cgi, apache2-mpm-worker
Conflicts: apache2-mpm-threadpool, apache2-mpm-prefork, apache2-mpm-perchild
Description: High speed threaded model for Apache HTTPD 2.1
 The worker MPM provides a threaded implementation for Apache HTTPD 2.1. It is
 considerably faster than the traditional model, and is the recommended MPM.
 .
 Worker generally is a good choice for high-traffic servers because it
 has a smaller memory footprint than the prefork MPM.

Package: apache2-mpm-prefork
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, apache2-common (= ${Source-Version})
Provides: apache2-modules, apache2, httpd, httpd-cgi, apache2-mpm-prefork
Conflicts: apache2-mpm-worker, apache2-mpm-threadpool, apache2-mpm-perchild
Description: Traditional model for Apache HTTPD 2.1
 This Multi-Processing Module (MPM) implements a non-threaded,
 pre-forking web server that handles requests in a manner similar to
 Apache 1.3. It is appropriate for sites that need to avoid threading for
 compatibility with non-thread-safe libraries. It is also the best MPM
 for isolating each request, so that a problem with a single request will
 not affect any other.
 .
 It is not as fast, but is considered to be more stable.

Package: apache2-mpm-event
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, apache2-common (= ${Source-Version})
Provides: apache2-modules, apache2, httpd, httpd-cgi
Conflicts: apache2-mpm-worker, apache2-mpm-threadpool, apache2-mpm-perchild
Description: Event driven model for Apache HTTPD 2.1
 The event Multi-Processing Module (MPM) is designed to allow more 
 requests to be served simultaneously by passing off some processing 
 work to supporting threads, freeing up the main threads to work on 
 new requests.
 .
 This MPM is especially suitable for sites that see extensive KeepAlive traffic

Description: utility programs for webservers
 Provides some add-on programs useful for any webserver.  These include:
  - ab (Apache benchmark tool)

  - htpasswd (Manipulate basic authentication files)
  - htdigest (Manipulate digest authentication files)
  - dbmmanage (Manipulate basic authentication files in DBM format, using perl)
  - htdbm (Manipulate basic authentication files in DBM format, using APR)
  - rotatelogs (Periodically stop writing to a logfile and open a new one)
  - split-logfile (Split a single log including multiple vhosts)
  - checkgid (Checks whether the caller can setgid to the specified group)
  - check_forensic (Extract mod_log_forensic output from apache log files)
