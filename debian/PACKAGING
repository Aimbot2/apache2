Overview
========

The Apache 2 web server package in Debian supports two types of reverse
dependencies: modules and web applications. They need to be treated differently
as their requirements are different. We have special requirements how to declare
dependencies against Apache 2 web server packages depending on the type of
package. Refer to the respective parts for extensive information.

Furthermore, there are several helper tools available to assist on common tasks.
These are outlined in their respective sub sections as well. You should use
these tools to get maintainer scripts and dependencies right.

Packaging Modules
=================

Modules are packages which are installing third party extensions to the Apache 2
web server which can be loaded at runtim to extend the functionality of the core
server. Please realize such modules make use of a stable Application Binary
Interface (ABI) once compiled which need a recompile if the web server changes.
Hence be careful how you declare dependencies against the web server. You need
to make sure it does not break upon upgrades.

A module package providing an Apache module must obey our policies to make sure
it can be upgraded without breakage at the installation site. To achieve this, a
package must build-depend on apache2-dev. This package provides the 'apxs'
compile helper which makes sure the module is compatible with the Apache 2 web
server and required include header.

The resulting binary package should be called libapache2-mod-<modulename> and
MUST NOT depend on apache2 or apache2-bin. Instead a module package must depend
on our virtual package providing the module magic number denoting the ABI
compatibility version number. The virtual package is called apache2-api-YYYYMMDD
and guaranteed to be stable among all binary updates of 2.4.x. The dh_apache2
helper assists to get dependencies right.

The module must install a 'module.load' file to /etc/apache2/modules-available
where 'module' is the name of the installed module without "mod_" prefix. The
'.load' file must contain an appropriate "LoadModule" directive only.
Additionally maintainers can declare module dependencies and conflicts in a magic
line in '.load' files which need to be resolved to load a module at the
installation site. This is useful if a module depends that other modules to be
loaded, or to conflict with other modules if they can't be loaded at the same
time. a2enmod and a2dismod will parse "# Depends: module[, module]" and "#
Conflicts: module[, module]" magic comments, for example to load mod_foo:

foo.load:

	# Depends: bar
	# Conflicts: baz
	LoadModule foo_module /usr/lib/modules/mod_foo.so


Additionally, a 'foo.conf' configuration file can be installed along the 'load'
file to configure the module following the same naming scheme if required. This
is useful if the module in question requires some initial configuration to be
useful. No magic comments are
recognized in '.conf' files.

In some rare cases it can't be avoided that a module depends on a loaded module
before another module can be loaded. However, modules are loaded in a sorted
alphabetical order. In most cases such pre-load dependencies could be avoided
upstream. If there is no way out that problem, you may want to add a conditional
Include in your own module file. Suppose mod_foo relies on mod_bar to be loaded
before, you may want to write a module 'load' file like this:

	# Depends: bar
	<IfModule !mod_bar.c>
		Include mods-enabled/bar.load
	</IfModule>

	LoadModule foo_module /usr/lib/modules/mod_foo.so

Please note, that th bar.load file must also contain a respective "<IfModule
!mod_bar.c>" guard as it would be loaded twice oterhwise. Use this method
extremely sparingly. In most cases a simple "Depends:" dependency does
the job, too. The "Depends:" magic line is still needed, to make sure that the
a2enmod/a2dismod scripts work correctly.

Maintainer scripts should not invoke a2enmod directly. Instead, the
apache2-maintscript-helper should be used. Please realize, the helper is not
guaranteed to be installed on the target system. There are certain setups which
do not require Debian specific configurations, so modules must not do anything
in maintainer scripts which makes use of Debian specific enhancements like
apache2-maintscript-helper, a2enmod, or a2query unconditionally. It is recommended
to invoke it like this:

        if [ -e /usr/share/apache2/apache2-maintscript-helper ] ; then
		. /usr/share/apache2/apache2-maintscript-helper
		apache2_invoke enmod foo
	fi

The dh_apache2 helper can be used to install module configuration and load
files. Additionally it generates appropriate maintainer scripts. The
apache2-maintscript-helper provides a few functions for common tasks. See their
respective reference documentations below.

Packaging Sites and Configurations for Web Applications
=======================================================

NOTE: This version of the apache2 package is still experimental. We expect
that the general configuration will still change in ways that may make it
necessary to adjust configuration files that are included in web applications.

Web applications are different from modules in that they do not have a hard
dependency on the web server. Typically they require a running web server,
but they do not need to worry about binary compatibility of modules. We accept
there are other web servers besides Apache, thus we discourage package
maintainers of web applications to depend unconditionally on Apache. That
said, we provide several helpers to assist web application packagers to invoke
configuration snippets to enable a web application in the Apache 2 web server.

We differentiate between two sub types: Sites and general configuration. Sites
are installed to /etc/apache2/sites-available and configure a particular
virtual hosts. Special care must be taken when installing a site configuration
to make sure it does not interfere with site local configuration the
administrator uses. Typically there are a few use cases only, where a Debian
package should include a virtual host configuration.

The general configuration snippets are installed to /etc/apache2/conf-available
instead. Package maintainers are advised to avoid "local-" prefixes to
installed conffiles, and ideally use "packagename.conf" to avoid name clashes.
This type of configration shall be used when installing a global (i.e. virtual
host independent) configuration. Usually these configuration snippets will be
included in the global server context via the conf-enabled directory. However,
it is planned to allow the administrator to only enable the configuration
snippets in a selected set of virtual hosts.

Typically a "packagename.conf" should enable a global alias pointing to your web
application along a script-dependendent per-script configuration, for example:

	Alias /packagename /usr/share/packagename

	<Directory /usr/share/packagename>
	  ...
	</Directory>

Please be careful about the directives you are using. Some might be available in
modules not enabled by default only. Suppose your <Directory> configuration can
be enhanced, but does not necessarily need to use mod_rewrite rules you could do
something like:

	<Directory /usr/share/packagename>
	  ...
	  <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
	   RewriteEngine on
	   RewriteRule ...
	  </IfModule>
	</Directory>

# XXX: TODO: What should web apps do if they /depend/ on optional modules?

For both types of configuration, dh_apache2 can be used to assist packagers.

Web applications must depend (or recommend) apache2 only. Web applications must
not depend or recommend apache2-bin or apache2-data packages. Generally web
server dependencies should be declared in the form:

	Depends: apache2 | <alternative web servers you support> | httpd-cgi

Using dh_apache2 assists you to do so, although dh_apache2 declares a weaker
Recommends relation only. If your web application depends on a particular web
server module you need to depend on it, too. For example, PHP applications might
need to formulate dependency lines in the form:

	Depends: libapache2-mod-php5 | php5-cgi | php5-fpm
	Recommends: apache2 | <alternative web servers you support> | httpd-cgi

Similar to modules, web applications can enable their configuration files in
maintainer scripts. Use of dh_apache2 is recommended to achieve this. Generally
special care must be taken not to use Apache2 Debian helper scripts like a2query
and a2enmod unconditionally. You can use the apache2-maintscript-helper tools
provided by the apache2 package for common tasks this way:

        if [ -e /usr/share/apache2/apache2-maintscript-helper ] ; then
		. /usr/share/apache2/apache2-maintscript-helper
		apache2_invoke enconf foo
	fi

Refer to the reference documentation below to learn how to use
apache2-maintscript-helper. Do not enable or disable modules in web
application maintainer scripts, instead protect your configuration by <IfModule>
clauses if you require non-standard modules.

Tools
=====

apache2-maintscript-helper
--------------------------

The apache2-maintscript-helper is a collection of functions which can be
sourced in maintainer scripts to do required tasks in a simple and
standardized way. It is NOT a script, it is a library
(insofar shell functions can be called as such). This is to avoid users to call
these functions. They are not meant to be used by users. The helper is installed
within the apache2 binary package. Thus you MUST NOT use any function of it
unconditionally, as for both modules and web applications there are use cases
when this package is not added as a dependency. Thus, use it in a protected
conditional like this only:

        if [ -e /usr/share/apache2/apache2-maintscript-helper ] ; then
		. /usr/share/apache2/apache2-maintscript-helper
		<call apache2-maintscript-helper specific functions>
	fi

The helper provides functions to enable and disable configuration files,
restart the web server, switch the MPM in use and similar. Refer to the source
code for detailed interface documentation. When available, please use the
apache2-maintscript-helper instead of calling helper scripts directly, as these
functions are careful to invoke and use particular helper. Later versions may
be configurable to allow the administrator to influence which actions are
preformed.

Always check the return code of the called function to find out whether
something went wrong:

	if ! apache2_invoke enmod modulename ; then
		echo "Whoops! Something went wrong"
	fi

dh_apache2
----------

dh_apache2 is a debhelper which can be used to install modules, module
configuration, site configuration and global configuration snippets. It assists
you to set appropriate dependencies and maintainer scripts. Refer to
dh_apache2(1) for full usage guidelines.

a2enmod
-------

a2enmod and its special invokations a2enconf, a2ensite, a2dismod, a2dissite and
a2disconf can be used to enable all types of Apache 2 configuration files. When
invoking these helpers in maintainer scripts, you should carefully check their
error return codes. Use these scripts with the -q (quiet) switch only in
maintainer scripts. Ideally you should not interface with this scripts
directly, instead it is recommended to use apache2-maintscript-helper. For
detailed usage refer to their respective man pages.

a2query
-------

a2query is a query tool to retrieve runtime status information about the Apache
2 web server instance. You can use this tool to get information about loaded
modules, the MPM used on the installation site, the module magic number and
other useful information. Use this script instead of accessing configuration
files in /etc/apache2 directly as it tries its best to return useful information
even on incomplete or broken configurations.

For example you can use a2query to retrieve the MPM enabled at the installation
site and make actions dependent on the result like this:

        [ -x /usr/sbin/a2query ] || exit $?
        CUR_MPM=$(a2query -M) || exit $?
	case "$CUR_MPM" in
		worker)
		;;
	...
	esac

Refer to the a2query(1) man page for the full documentation. Please note, the
apache2-maintscript-helper can be used to inteface with this task as well.
